#Music Match
The Music Matcher allows you to search a song title or artist to find a song and it’s matching lyrics. Once you enter the search criteria, the top 10 search results from MusiXmatch are retuned. From the list of results, you can click the song you were looking for. The lyrics to your selected song will appear and you are provided a play button to play a small sample of your song. 
You are able to save your favorites by clicking the heart icon to the right of your selected song. 
In addition, Music Match will display the top 5 MusixMatch rated songs and allow you to select them as favorites as well.
