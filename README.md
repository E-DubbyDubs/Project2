## Project 2: Pie Space!


## Description 

Pie Space is a full stack app built using the MVC paradigm and Edamam API that allows a user to create an account, and search for recipes by typing the name of the receipe into the receipe search bar. The app also displays ingredients of each receipe that is clicked on. Additionally, users can input their own receipes by adding ingredients and saving this to a shopping list. 

It utilizes Node and Express Web Server, and is backed by MySQL Database and an ORM.
This app also uses both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data, and is deployed using Heroku (with Data).
